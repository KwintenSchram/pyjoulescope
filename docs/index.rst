-------------------

Welcome to the Joulescopeâ„¢ driver's documentation.  This driver enables you to
automate Joulescope operation and easily measure current, voltage, power and
energy within your own Python programs on Windows,
Linux, and macOS.
With the Joulescope driver, controlling your Joulescope is easy.  This 
example captures 0.1 seconds of data and then prints the average current
and voltage::

    import joulescope
    import numpy as np
    with joulescope.scan_require_one(config='auto') as js:
        data = js.read(contiguous_duration=0.1)
    current, voltage = np.mean(data, axis=0, dtype=np.float64)
    print(f'{current} A, {voltage} V')
